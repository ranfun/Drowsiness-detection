Faces contain information that can be used to interpret levels of drowsiness. There are many facial features that can be extracted from the face to infer the level of drowsiness. These include eye blinks, head movements and yawning. However, the development of a drowsiness detection system that yields reliable and accurate results is a challenging task as it requires accurate and robust algorithms. A wide range of techniques has been examined to detect driver drowsiness in the past. The recent rise of deep learning requires that these algorithms be revisited to evaluate their accuracy in detection of drowsiness.
